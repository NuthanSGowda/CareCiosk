The Pharmacy Management System is developed to address the challenges faced by pharmacies in managing their inventory, and tracking sales efficiently. This system automates key processes, reducing manual errors and improving operational efficiency. The primary objective is to create a centralized database that stores information about medicines, customers, suppliers, and transactions, with a user-friendly interface for pharmacy staff to interact with the system.
